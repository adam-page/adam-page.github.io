This first course in the DeepLearning.ai specialization on Coursera  honestly went pretty fast for me, and I don’t have too much to say about  it. As usual for Andrew Ng’s courses (or what seems to be the norm,  this being the second of two courses this way) there was a nice balance  between mathematical rigor and choosing an approach that intuitively  made sense without bogging down in the details. As usual I would’ve  liked more mathematical challenge, but the way the material was all  presented was fine and the course likely only went quickly because I’d  previously tinkered with L layered neural networks and I recently took  the machine learning course.

Overall I’d recommend this course specifically for anyone wanting to  learn the nuts and bolts of a neural network, and I think any  practitioner should have at least the amount of knowledge presented in  this course, and indeed a lot more. I am glad they made the switch to  Python, as while it is far from my language it is at least in the family  of languages regularly used by programmers, and it does have excellent  support for this kind of software. Lastly I thought the interviews with  “heroes of deep learning” were interesting, although as usual I would’ve  liked a bit more depth into specifically why or what the interviewee  had done to impact the field. I had heard of Ian Goodfellow for example,  and knew that he created generative adversarial models, but I would’ve  liked to hear a bit more on the specifics of what was around before that  and what he did to fashion the model (and indeed what the model even  looks like.)

Overall though the course was a good introduction and as I stated I  likely breezed through it partly because of prior experience (I’m more  interested in the later parts of the specialization which I have no  experience with) and partly because of how succinctly the material is  presented. I’d say the course isn’t quite as high quality as Machine  Learning, but overall was enjoyable and a good introduction to what will  likely be a good series of courses.
