### {{site.description}}

Welcome to my personal website. Click ‘Portfolio’ above to see various code examples and challenges I worked through. Projects also will have a sample of larger-scale projects I’m working on along with notes about those projects if applicable. The rest of the site consists of blog categories and each category will have various posts, ordered by date.

Below is a picture of my son and I during a hike at Big Bend National Park:
