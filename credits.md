### Images: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
Unsplash has completely free photos anyone can use for personal or commercial use. They have some incredibly talented photographers--its worth a look!

### Icons: [IconsDB.com](https://www.iconsdb.com/)

The icons are all under free licenses, much like the Unsplash images, but I would like to mention that the site is a great resource for free icons.

### Theme: [Midnight Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight)

I have slightly modified the Jekyll theme Midnight for my use here, although other than adding some buttons to the top bar and changing their color from green to blue, the credit all goes to the creator of this dark theme for GitHub Pages.

### Hosting: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)

Originally I went with WordPress for my site hosting and publication, but it just was a bit much for me. GitHub Pages with Jekyll provide a simple interface and I can write in the markdown file format. As this is the format I use for my personal notes it seemed a nice transition, and Jekyll also provides a gem that allows you to run the site locally for development.

### Personal Pictures: My Wife, Kalen

Most of the pictures on the Pictures site come from my wife Kalen during our many adventures. She is always keen to have her camera with her to capture the moment (I often forget) and as I use her photos for both public and personal use I can't thank her enough for always being ready!

### Ideas (where not cited): Me?...ish.

I am very grateful for my teachers and colleagues at Oregon State University, my friend and mentor Mike, and my supportive family for the opportunity to study and the materials, lessons, and advice along the way. Additionally I have found the online computer science community to be generally helpful, understanding, and inviting; this is something I did not expect but I am grateful for. If this doesn't include you (computer scientist or not), then it probably should.
