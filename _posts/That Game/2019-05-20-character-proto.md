## Thoughts

There’s certainly openness for branching here, but I think it’d be best to just get this designed for 5 jobs and a handful of weapons to start with, and then we can start getting fancy.

I like this design because it imposes no sense of class on the character or player, and they can essentially free form for whatever they’d like. It’d even be cool to let them save this slot (among their 5) as a custom class name, perhaps displayed when inspected. Obviously there are bad combinations, such as taking offensive and wielding a magic staff…but that’s for the player to enjoy (while sucking) or learn from.

Weapons are levelled based on usage while I like the idea of giving a flat % split to any incidental jobs whenever the character gains experience. For now we only have either solo job or duo job, but due to the combination if you duo job you don’t really lose anything, and in fact you gain some interesting combination skills which may or may not be worth it. 

It would be important for hardcore multi-classers (looking at you Sim) to keep tracking experience even when the character level is max, as job levels can still be obtained, allowing for other class slots to occupy something like a fiendish dark-magic backstabbing rogue or a druidic bow-wielding healer.

Lastly there’s a lot more room for improvement and expansion here. The idea was to get a basic character down to show that even for the most basic guy, there’s a lot going on. We could explore more frequent actives for either jobs or weapons, more/different jobs, and how weapons/magic interact vis-a-vis elemental grips or whatever else.
