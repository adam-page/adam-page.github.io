#### **SPAM!**

In a word that was the topic for the week, and much like last week this is a topic that any user of this type of technology has had some experience with. To be perfectly frank one of the most interesting thoughts I had this week was to note that I hadn't really thought about email spam much recently. Most of my spam concerns are now dealt with by spam filters driven by both expert systems and machine learning systems, and as a result I very rarely come face-to-face with the kind of spam we faced in class.

All the same I wasn't too out of practice and did quite well on the in-lecture quiz on spam. Unfortunately the website that was linked is no longer a service offered, but I found others like it and did about as well. When I wasn't sure I aired on the side of caution, which was another interesting point I'll get to later. Overall though I was glad that my use of email in my early days of computing gave me a good sense of what was spam and what was worth a click. As far as classifiers go I would be as interested in them as I was last week for URL classifiers, strictly because the machine learning field is one that I have great interest in and do a fair amount of self-study on.

One of the philosophical points brought up was that it was worse to block a legitimate email than it was to allow a bit of spam through. I don't downright disagree, but I think its a topic worth investigating further, so lets have a look. For someone like me, who is reasonably well informed on how this technology works as well as what spam does (or could) look like, I think this is a perfectly reasonable system. If I get an email from my bank I never directly click links in the email and always go to the website I know to be legitimate. Again this doesn't happen often, but were it to I wouldn't be likely to enter my banking information and send it off to an unknown corner of the internet for someone to use nefariously. Compare that to some of the other people in my family and this is certainly not the case! I think the stereotype is that its generally older people, but frankly that just isn't always the case. Regardless anyone in technology probably knows people who aren't as savvy, and as such can relate to the notion that in this case it may be better to block a perhaps legitimate email if it means that no spam gets through.

Lets return to the banking analogy, as it presents high stakes and nearly universal use by people with access to this type of technology. If I were to use this kind of high-blocking spam filter, then perhaps I would miss an email from my bank regarding an important notice or something that requires my attention. Two points become relevant here: 1) if something is of great importance and requires my immediate attention, the bank will call me in addition to sending an email and 2) I generally am appraised or expecting it when something major is happening-I'm aware of my own financial situation. The first point has more to do with the fact that if you're needed, the bank will reach out. If a decision is required by you, then it won't be made without you and thus you will be contacted. In the instance where this reaching out isn't the best by your financial institution this can be easily remedied by simply reaching out to them on a fairly regular basis. As far as expecting or being appraised of major changes, this just has to do with how I handle my finances, and if the norm is to get massive, unexpected changes in personal finances regularly, then we reach the end of the scope of this discussion.

I think a philosophy that aligns with the user and their skill set would be the best happy medium here. In fact I think this is perhaps something we could apply to all internet based technology. Not everyone has the same level of knowledge about this technology and how to use it, and as a result not everyone will require the same privacy, protection, and filtering to ensure their content is legitimate. Currently we are seeking to find a one-size-fits-all method to make the internet better for everyone, while failing to acknowledge that we can't even make a hat that fits everyone.
