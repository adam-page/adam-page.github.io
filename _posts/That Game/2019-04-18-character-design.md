# That Game Character Design

### Adam Page

## Character

A character is a single login. It will do the story, all associated unlock quests tied to the main story, etc. It will have a level that is gained through experience fighting monsters. This level will also cap things like a max weapon level (more on weapon levels later) and max job levels.

## Class Slots

A character will have some number of class slots (5 here) that save all associated allocations.

### Appearance

Emp you can kinda fill this in tbh. Basically the combinations of job levels will determine what the armor looks like..perhaps varied by level if you want? Makes it easy to design, easy to load, easy to code. Color glamors?

### Stat Allocation

Stats impact job passives/abilities and weapon damage/skills. The numbers (and names) here are obviously up for negotiation.

### Job Levels

Ah the bread and butterâ€¦.

#### Job levels

A job gains levels as you level your class. Job levels can also be gained at max level (because your jobs might not be max), but basically you get some % of experience based on your allocation. For example if I have 30 points in martial and 10 in light, if I get 100 experience I get 75 experience in martial and 25 in light.

#### Job Allocation Caps

30 to allocate any points to a second job, 50 for a third. No more than three. Each job has a linear set of traits and abilities, but so does each combination (so martial has a set, but so does martial/light, as does martial/light/athletics).

#### Job Combinations

So max of three combinations, but not required. Ultimately you have 100 job points at level 100 and whatever combinations you produce are up to you!

#### Alternate Ideas

1. Levelling-pick a job to level and that one gets 100% of your character experience.

### Weapons

#### Weapon Level

A weapon has an independent  level, not based on character level. To level a weapon you get experience based on character experience gained *if you used that weapon to kill the experience source*. If multiple weapons were used, the experience is split evenly (?) between the two.

#### Weapon Skills

1. A single linear path of weapon skills unique to the weapon. More weapons needed here.
2. A tree of multiple skill paths that make the number of weapons needed less, but the skill trees here harder to balance and design.
