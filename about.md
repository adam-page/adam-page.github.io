# {{page.title}}

I am a husband, father, teacher, computer programmer, AI enthusiast, musician, runner, and gamer. This site is my professional front-page and holds my professional portfolio, information about personal projects (big and small), and any blog content that I have either through my own desire to write or have written for class requirements.

I am also on:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-page-7686a3175/)
- [Gmail](mailto:pageadj@gmail.com)
