# Website to do list

1. update permalinks (after week 5 progress report is graded)
2. portfolio code mermaid-ize message seq example, or just put some That Game stuff in there?
3. projects-lets start with That Game
4. fix pictures - size/load time is quite large and theyâ€™re oversized for even my large browser
5. create more blog categories and get writing!
