#### From meeting on 05/23/2019

## Ground layout

### Hex ground layout

* collision with enemies, not with friendlies
* no stacking in non-city areas

## Targeting

* clicking and targets probably, auto-targeting definitely
  * lock on system camera dependent

## Spells

1. single target
2. targeted aoe
3. small ground aoe
   * different shapes
4. large ground aoe

## Movement

### Models

* Revalation

## Elements/Statuses

* Elemental wheel/resistance tied to cc save, length and damage taken
* Resistances tied to stats and adds to that resistance

## Duration

* Fights last longer than landing one skill
* Damage spikes and impervious walls rare edge cases, but not impossible
