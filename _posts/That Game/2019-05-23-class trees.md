## Basic Mechanics

* each class has its own independent level that levels independently of overall character level
* at level 10 the option for a second class opens
  * second jobs receive 100% of the job experience recieved
  * you may put as many points into the trees you have up to their level cap, with a cap on the number of points equivalent to your character level
* at level 20 you get the option for a tertiary class
  * experience works the same as secondary (100% job experience for all classes)
  * similarly you still only have character level number of points to spend among the three trees
* each class has three sub trees and each of these sub trees can combo with any other sub tree the character has a level in
  * this creates a large number of combinations that are possible
  * the sub tree skills will require a certain number of points spent in the subclasses that open it

## Basic Classes

	* Melee
	* Ranged
	* Defense
	* Light Magic
	* Dark Magic

## Sub Classes

* there are 15 possible here, and each must have points to spend up to level 40

## Combo Classes

* 105 possible combinations, each with a name
* skills in this tree will depend on the skill level from sub-classes to unlock, but currently there need not be an even distribution or cap in order to limit these
* if limiting complexity is needed we could cap these at 20 or 30 as a max level for skills in these trees
* for triple class names perhaps just combine the two combination class names? otherwise naming each possible combination of 3 sub-classes and combination classes gets quite large
* another option here, since each character slot is so customizable anyways, why not just let the player name their class?
